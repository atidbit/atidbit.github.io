**Abstract** — _The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore how federal government
employees of Hawaii described psychological safety and their supervisors’ influence on
psychological safety in the workplace. Transformational leadership theory and the
psychosocial safety climate (PSC) theory served as the theoretical foundation for this study
to explore the phenomenon of psychological safety in the workplace. Two research
questions (RQs) were used during this investigation: 1) How do federal government
employees describe psychological safety in their workplace? and 2) How do federal
government employees describe their supervisors’ influence on psychological safety in
their workplace? The study targeted an estimated 12,053 employees in federal government
organizations from the Federal Employees of the U.S. Government LinkedIn Group to
achieve a total of 46 participants for the questionnaire that was delivered online through
SurveyMonkey. Among the questionnaire participants, 14 participated in a follow-on
Zoom interview. Thematic analysis of the data was conducted using Braun and Clarke’s
six-step process. As a result, six themes were identified to answer the RQs. The findings
suggest that behavioral output, resulting from motivation and organization policy, affect
how well employees contribute, express ideas, speak up, and engage in a psychologically
safe workplace. For future research, it is recommended that this study be replicated to
expand to different government populations and at all levels of government (e.g., local,
state, federal) throughout the United States_.
